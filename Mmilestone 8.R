# Load the Iris dataset
data(iris)

# Choose the quantitative columns for the analysis
data <- iris[, c("Sepal.Length", "Sepal.Width")]

# Perform linear regression: Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width
model <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width, data=data)

# Assess the fit of the model and compute R-squared
summary(model)
residuals <- residuals(model)

# Plot a histogram of the residuals
hist(residuals, main="Histogram of Residuals", xlab="Residuals")

# Plot a scatterplot of observed response vs. residuals
plot(data$Sepal.Width, residuals, main="Scatterplot of Sepal Width vs. Residuals", xlab="Sepal Width", ylab="Residuals")

# Add the description of the model and results to your webpage
# Model Equation: Sepal.Length = a + b * Sepal.Width
# a: Intercept, b: Slope
# R-squared: 0.01159 (R-squared measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable)

# Interpretation:
# The linear regression model does not appear to be a good fit. The low R-squared value of 0.01159 suggests that only a small proportion of the variance in Sepal.Length is explained by Sepal.Width. Additionally, the scatterplot of Sepal Width vs. Residuals does not show any clear linear relationship, and the histogram of residuals is not normally distributed. Therefore, the linear regression model may not provide a meaningful prediction of Sepal.Length based on Sepal.Width.
