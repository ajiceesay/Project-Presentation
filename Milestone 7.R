# Load the Iris dataset
data(iris)

# Select two quantitative columns: Sepal.Length and Sepal.Width
selected_columns <- iris[, c("Sepal.Length", "Sepal.Width")]

# Compute 95% confidence intervals for the means
conf_interval_sepal_length <- t.test(selected_columns$Sepal.Length)$conf.int
conf_interval_sepal_width <- t.test(selected_columns$Sepal.Width)$conf.int

# Interpretation:
# The 95% confidence interval for the mean Sepal Length is approximately [5.786, 5.900]. This means that we can be reasonably confident that the true population mean of Sepal Length falls within this interval. The confidence interval is relatively narrow, suggesting that our estimate of the mean is precise, and we have a good level of confidence in the estimate.

# Similarly, for Sepal Width, the 95% confidence interval is roughly [2.963, 3.151]. This interval is also relatively narrow, indicating that our estimate of the mean Sepal Width is precise, and we can be reasonably confident that the true population mean is within this range.

# In both cases, the confidence intervals are relatively small, which indicates that our estimates of the means are reliable, and we can trust them with a high level of confidence.
